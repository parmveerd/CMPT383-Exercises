.into_iter():
a. It takes the vector as its argument.
b. It returns an iterator of type T.
c. The values that are produced are of type T.
d. Used when we want to change the ownership of the vector and consume the vector while iterating.

.iter()
a. Take reference to the vector as it does not need to own it and just needs to read elements.
b. It returns an iterator of elements &T in vector.
c. The values produced are references to elements of type T.
d. It is used when we want to iterate over the elements without changing them.

.iter_mut()
a. It borrows the vector, since it needs to change the elements during iteration.
b. It returns an iterator with mutable references to elements, &mut T.
c. The values produced are mutable references to elements of type T.
d. It is used when we want to iterate over elements of the vector, in order to change them.

.drain()
a. It borrows the vector, since it needs to be able to remove elements.
b. It returns an elements of type T, that have been removed.
c. The values produced are elements of type T.
d. It is used when we want to rmeove elements from the vector wihtout altering the other elements.
